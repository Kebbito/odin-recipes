    <h1>Pupusas Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../images/Pupusas.jpeg" alt="Pupusas" />
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 cups masa harina , white or yellow</li>
      <li>3 1/2 - 4 cups warm water</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon of salt</li>
      <li>2 Tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon chicken bouillon paste</li>
      <li>1 can refried beans</li>
      <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Add masa harina (corn flour) and salt to a large mixing bowl. Add the
        warm water, little by little, mixing the dough with your hand. You may
        not need all of the water. You want the masa to be the consistency of a
        soft play dough. If the dough is too wet, mix in some more masa harina.
        If itâ€™s too dry, add a little more water. Mix in butter and chicken
        bouillon, if using.
      </li>
      <li>
        Scoop the dough into large, golf-ball-size portions. You can scoop all
        of the dough into balls before continuing, or make 1 pupusa at a time.
        Be sure to keep the dough covered with a damp cloth as you work, to keep
        it from drying out.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use the palms of your hands to pat the dough into a disc, about 4 inches
        in diameter. Scoop about half a tablespoon of the beans and place it in
        the center of the dough circle, followed by a pinch of shredded cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gently bring the edges of the dough up and around the filling, pinching
        it closed into a ball. Gently pat the dough between your palms to form
        it into a disc again. Be gentle so you do not have big cracks of filling
        come through, but if you do have some, its fine! They do not need to be
        perfect.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a large un-greased skillet or pan over medium heat. Place pupusas
        on the hot pan and cook for about 2-4 minutes on each side. You will
        know the pupusas are ready to flip when the edges are set and the bottom
        is lightly golden.
